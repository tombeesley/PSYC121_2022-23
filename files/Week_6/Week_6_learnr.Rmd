## Exploring the data

For this week's online tutorial we have loaded in a new selection of the data (which we've stored as `data_phone`) from the PSYC121 questionnaire. Let's take a look at the data we have using the `summary()` function. 

```{r summary_example, exercise=TRUE}

summary(data_phone)

```

###

You can see that we have 4 variables (columns) in our data. The first 2 are "character" variables, which reflect nominal (or "categorical") data. The 3rd and 4th variables are numerical, and here we see interesting summary statistics. 

We'll use the `count()` function again to explore each nominal variable.

```{r count_example, exercise=TRUE}
count(data_phone, sibling_order)
count(data_phone, phone_type)
```

## Visualising the data

Visualisation is a very important aspect of data analysis, and in this tutorial we will start to learn the basics of data visualisation in R. Let's start by drawing a simple "box plot", like we drew back in Week 2. 

```{r simple_boxplot, exercise=TRUE}

data_phone %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(aes(y = screen_time_actual))

```
###

As a reminder, the boxplot shows the *median* in a thick black line, with the outer edges of the box representing the *1st and 3rd quartiles*. The whiskers extend out 1.5 * the inter-quartile range (3rd minus 1st quartile). Any points outside of the whiskers are plotted individually and might be considered "outliers" (particularly unusual data points).

**Please read the following carefully, as it explains the basic logic of the ggplot tools**

The ggplot code here takes a little explanation. First, we are sending the data, `data_phone`, to our graphing commands. The main graphing command is `ggplot()` which tells R we want to draw some kind of plot. If you want to, you can just run `data_phone %>% ggplot()`, and you'll see that R produces just a blank plot window (press "start over" to get the other code back). The plot is blank because we haven't told it a) what type of plot we want, and b) what data to plot.

Note that the next line is **added** to `ggplot()` (i.e., `ggplot() + geom_boxplot()`). Plotting with `ggplot()` involves adding elements (geoms) together. Think of it as adding layers on top of each other: the ggplot() is your pizza base, and the geoms and other features are the toppings! 

Within the `geom_boxplot()` command we have the very important command of `aes()`. This stands for **aesthetics**. `aes()` tells ggplot how the data should be represented on the features of the plot. Here, we want our boxplot of data to be shown on the y axis. What do you think will happen if you change y to x? Try it!

### Adding more variables 

For the simple boxplot above, the axis that is not being used is given a meaningless scale. We can use this axis to separate our data by one of the nominal variables:

```{r boxplot_factor, exercise=TRUE}

data_phone %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(aes(y = screen_time_actual, x = phone_type))

```

Now our plot has a meaningful x-axis and we gain some information about how users of different phone types tend to use their phones (they are in fact very similar!). Try replacing  *phone_type* with the other nominal variable *sibling_order*, to explore whether that variable affects phone use.

## Aesthetics and variables

The x and y features of the plot are not the only things we can play with in ggplot. For example, we might decide we want yellow boxes, with purple lines and points (and why not?!) - pretty much anything is possible:

```{r boxplot_features, exercise=TRUE}

data_phone %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(aes(y = screen_time_actual, x = phone_type),
               fill = "yellow",
               colour = "purple")

```

Careful observation of the code here will show you that these new commands are written **outside** of the `aes()` command. This is really important to note. We write these outside of `aes()` because these features of the plot **are not related to the data**. We are NOT *mapping* any of our data to these features. Instead, we are simply specifying one particular value for each of these "settings" in the plot (*fill* colour is yellow; line *colour* is purple).

That's not to say we cannot make these features related to our data. For example, complete the code below so that *fill* is mapped to the *sibling_order* variable within the `aes()` command. Use the same mapping for y (the same DV) that you used in the previous graph above:

```{r fill_mapping, exercise=TRUE}
# INCOMPLETE CODE - You need to replace each "MISSING" in the code BEFORE running

data_phone %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(aes(y = "MISSING", fill = "MISSING"))

```

How data is mapped to the features of the plot, and which features are not related to the data is obviously really important. We will practice this more in the R Studio work in class.

## Making things pretty!

Data visualisation is all about communicating your results in the best way possible. Sometimes you just want to quickly draw a plot, but when writing reports, or giving a presentation, it's important to take the time to make everything clear and appealing to your audience.

A very simple way to do this is the change the *theme* of the plot. Here we add (+) the line `theme_classic()` to the graph. 

```{r add_theme, exercise=TRUE}

data_phone %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(aes(y = screen_time_actual, fill = sibling_order)) +
  theme_classic() # try changing this to the other options below

```

Here are a few themes you might like to try: `theme_light()`, `theme_dark()`, `theme_minimal()`, `theme_void()`

### Adding labels

You can see that `ggplot` has used the variable names from the data to label the axis. This is OK for a quick look, but when writing a report we will want to smarten this up a bit by replacing these. You do that by adding *labels* with `labs()`:

```{r add_labels, exercise=TRUE}

data_phone %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(aes(y = screen_time_actual, fill = sibling_order)) +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(y = "Time spent on phone",
       fill = "Sibling type")

```

```{r add_labels-hint}

data_phone %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(aes(y = screen_time_actual, fill = sibling_order)) +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(y = "Time spent on phone",
       fill = "Sibling type",
       title = )

```

Try adding an additional statement within `labs()` for the `title`. For example it might start "A graph showing the..."
