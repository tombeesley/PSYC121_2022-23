By this we mean You have watched the lecture video, made notes, and developed questions where you have them. You have worked through the online prelab preparation materials - Here is the one for Week 1 You read the lab sheet (this one) to get a sense of what were going to be doing, and you anticipate potential problems so that you can focus on these in the session. The lecture is designed to deliver important ideas and procedures for learning about analysis. Pre-lab material is then designed to help consolidate this learning, or enhance, expand and apply it in ways that set the scene for the lab session activity.We want to prepare you to be ready to go in the session itself and make the most of your time there. Want additional support? Keep in mind that the Department has endorsed and will use the Statistics textbook by David Howell called Fundamental statistics for the behavioral sciences The book covers principles of statistics as well as some tutorials on using R. You can access a library copy from the library pages 1.2 Activities for this week 1.3 Task 1 - check-in with the University attendance register When you arrive, make sure you have checked-in to your Analysis session in the Levy lab. All students are required by the University to confirm attendance at taught session Staff will remind you of this in your class. 1.4 Task 2 - Getting dicy Heres a simple task for you to complete as a group around each of the workstations; You will be given a pair of dice Working in pairs, one person rolls both dice. Add up the total on each of them and have someone record that total (if you dont have some spare paper or a pen, use your computer) Repeat those steps 20 times. Then swap over your roles (the person rolling the dice, the person recording the outcome) Once everyone at the workstation has had a turn at this, each person should attempt to work out (a) the mean and (b) the median of their dice roll total. Check each others working, and discuss any differences or problems you have. Are all your answers the same? Why / why not? If not, are they very different or very similar? 1.5 Task 3 - Using RStudio 1.5.1 Introducing R Studio R and RStudio is the software that we will be using to explore and learn about analysis in your Psychology degree. Its a computational engine: a very snazzy calculator that you should see as your friend and ally in the journey to understand and appreciate psychology. It sits alongside what we teach about the concepts and interpretation of statistical analysis. R is the core software, RStudio is the interface for interacting with it. Put another way, R is the engine, RStudio is the cockpit. Like even a simplest calculator, it just does what you ask (at least when you ask nicely!) but it requires the user to know what they want from it and to understand what it is telling you. A calculator cant help a kid get the right answer to a multiplication problem if they dont know the difference between multiplication and division and addition etc. And whilst a calculator is brilliant at doing the number crunching (and as a bonus, R Studio can help with turning the numbers into beautiful graphs and images too), even a calculator requires a thoughtful person to take the answers and make sensible interpretations from them. Therefore, we need to learn both about the concepts of statistical analysis on the one hand, and the processing of statistical information -through R- on the other. The lectures will provide the starting point and the direction for statistical concepts, whilst these analysis labs provide the more practical experiences in how to use R, and how to make R your ally. Over the next year, in these labs we will increasingly be using RStudio to focus on the latter, processing side, which will allow you to focus your energies on the conceptual side and its relevance for appreciating psychology. 1.5.2 Getting started with RStudio For Lancaster University Psychology Students in 2022, we will be learning about R Studio through a simple but powerful web server architecture. That is, through the power of the internet, you can access and use R Studio by logging into a free account that we have provided and we will maintain for your use. Heres a little secret: There are several different ways to access RStudio. For example, you can download a copy of the software onto your computer, or use a Virtual Machine set up to run a copy. Theres nothing to stop you having your local copy, but please note - we cant support your own version through lab classes. Were using the web server to make sure everyone has the same, controlled experience. You will have received an email with your account information to log onto From a computer on the campus wifi, you can access R Studio at: Lancaster Psychology R Studio Server At the login screen, use your university username (e.g., bloggsj) Your password for R Studio is: [password here] As it says in the subject line, please keep your account details safe! 1.5.3 What does RStudio look like? When RStudio starts, it will look something like this: RStudio has three panels or windows: there are tabs for Console (taking up the left hand side), Environment (and History top right) , Current file (bottom right). You will also see a 4th window for a script or set of commands you develop, also (on the left hand side). 1.5.4 Lets get started! The first thing we want to do in RStudio is to create a folder for this week so that we can put the relevant material there and keep it tidy. From the lower-right panel of RStudio, click the files tab. Select the new folder option and create a new folder (eg week 1) Click on that folder to open it Next, weve prepared some instructions for RStudio to use - this is called a script. So we need to get this script into the server for you to explore and play with Download the zip file by clicking this link Find the location of the file on your computer and check it is saved as a .zip file Return to RStudio Click Upload Click choose file and find the file on your computer. Select the file and click Open. Click OK You should now see the files extracted in the directory. If you receive an unexpected server error please try this process in a different browser. If you still have trouble, send your username to t.beesley@lancaster.ac.uk for support. You should now have the script available in RStudio. Use SaveAs to create a new version of the script. By doing this, youll be able to have a before and after version of the script and can go back over the changes In the script, select or highlight the first line of text, which is this one: 1.5.4.1 Run your first ever R instruction! 5 + 5 and run this line. That tells RStudio to carry out the instruction. You should see that in the console tab, RStudio calculates the answer to this incredibly hard maths challenge! (amazing huh? OK, maybe not *that* amazing). 1.5.4.2 Modify your first ever R instruction! Use your imagination  add a new line to the script and ask a different simple arithmetic question of your own choosing! What happens? 1.5.4.3 Calculate descriptive stats in R for the first time! In this weeks analysis lecture, we looked at measures of central tendency and how to calculate them. So lets get R to do these calculations also! First, we tell R about the data used in the lecture. Weve already created the instruction that will do exacly this and it is in the script, so run this line from the script week_1_lecture_data &lt;- c(7,8,8,7,3,1,6,9,3,8) This creates an object called week_1_lecture_data. We can then perform calculations on this object. For example, we can find the mean by running the following command (use the script to do this) mean(week_1_lecture_data) Check the answer is the same we found in the lecture (it should be 6!). Next, lets ask for the median by running this line from the script: median(week_1_lecture_data) This also should be the answer from the lecture (7) R doesnt have a single corresponding command for the mode, but we can use the block of code in the script for this that starts and ends with the getmode text (there are 6 lines of text) This is just a bit of clever jiggery-pokery that gets the mode. What does R say the mode is? 1.5.4.4 Your challenge How can you get RStudio to verify / check the dice calculations that you attempted earlier? Think about how you might solve this problem, on the basis of what we have covered so far. We will discuss this in class and attempt to get RStudio to check your answers. In doing so, annotate the script (add notes for you - not RStudio) using the # command 1.6 Before you finish Make sure you save a copy of the script that you have been working on by the end of the session. This provides you with the record - the digital trace - on what you have done. And it means you can come back and repeat any of the work you have performed. End your session on the RStudio server, this logs you out of the server and stops any ongoing activities and tasks you have set up, maybe in the background. There is a red power button near the top right of the R studio window (do ask for help if you cant find it). Its a good habit to get into to turn the session off 1.6.1 Extra content for outside the lab class In the Howell text book on statistics, theres some R code on descriptive statistics. It is included in the script for you to look at and play with. in your own time and think about the following: In R, &lt;- is the assignment operator as in the command we used: PSYC121_week_1_data &lt;- c(7,8,8,7,3,1,6,9,3,8) We create the variable label on the left (Analysis_week1_data) and we give it those numbers on the right. The nameAnalysis_week1_data` is largely arbitrary: try use a variable of your own naming (your own name?) instead - and then use that alternative name for the other commands. Throughout this year, well use the convention of the underscore to separate words in labels (it_makes_them_easier_to_read than ifyoudidnthaveanyspaces) 1.7 Task 4  Review the learnr sample / practice questions After every block of teaching in part-1 analysis (specifically, we mean in week 5, week 10, week 15 and week 20) there will be a class test. This will assess your knowledge and your understanding of the material that has been covered. The class test will comprise a set of Multiple Choice Questions (and the set of questions will be different for each student, as the test will involve random selection from a larger pool) under timed conditions. In order to help you get (a) a broad or basic feel for the sort of questions you might get in the class test (b) self-review your progress through the term, we will provide MCQs each week for you to attempt. So these are for your benefit you can take the questions when you choose to, and the learnr quiz will provide feedback on the answers your provide. Just bear in mind: We place a set of questions at the end of the learnr pages so that you can attempt these at the end of each week, after youve completed lab activities, follow-up work, weekly Q&amp;As etc. But its up to you when you answer the questions These are meant as indicative questions. Theres no point in learning/ memorising these questions (they wont be on the quiz!) and our advice is to reflect on how the teaching and content links to the sorts of questions that get posed. 1.8 Task 5  Data collection exercise In order to learn about psychology and data analysis techniques, we need data! Rather than rely too much on artificial data (certainly it is sometimes useful to say Here are a bunch of numbers and this is what we can do with them  think about the R Studio example for this weeks lab) for the most part, we prefer to draw on datasets that are a bit more engaging and meaningful that you have a stake in yourself! By using a common data set, that we can return to over the year, we can also build up familiarity and confidence in the data and remove a potential obstacle to thinking about the more important analysis part. So a key task will be for everyone to have a go at taking our online survey, and contribute to a dataset that can be used throughout the year. We would like you to complete the survey via your Department Sona system account. This way, you will receive a research credit for doing so, to jump start your credit account. The sona system is can be accessed by following this link "],["week-2-descriptive-statistics-in-rstudio.html", "2 Week 2: Descriptive statistics in RStudio 2.1 Pre-lab work 2.2 Lab exercises - descriptive information in R Studio", " 2 Week 2: Descriptive statistics in RStudio 2.1 Pre-lab work Last week, among other things, we asked you to Roll some dice, carry out some (relatively) straightforward hand calculations of central tendency Connect to the RStudio server and create a folder Within RStudio upload and run a script - a set of instructions, and explore annotations Adapt the script commands to perform calculations on the dice rolls within RStudio Complete a survey so that we can collect data for analysis teaching Your progress was great! We start with small steps and build up - but this is a nice start and were pleased how things went! Before the lab, make sure you have worked through the material in the week2 learnr tutorial. The link is here 2.1.1 R Studio tasks For a reminder of how to start RStudio, see week 1 lab sheet (remember: off campus, you will need to be on the VPN) A word of advice (from David Howells statistics book: One more word of adviceI cant resist adding what is perhaps the best advice I have. If there is something that you dont understand, just remember that Google is your friend. She certainly is mine. (Well, maybe Google is getting a bit pushy, but there are many other search sites.) If you dont understand what Fishers Exact Test is, or you dont like my explanation, go to Google and type in Fishers Exact Test. I just did that and had 260,000 hits. You cant tell me that there isnt going to be something useful in there.) 2.1.2 Bringing data, scripts and files into R Studio In week 1, we had a tiny dataset (relatively speaking) that we entered into R through a script line. That worked for what is was. But its going to become painful and tedious when (a) we want to work with larger datasets (b) we have data more complex than a 1-dimensional list of numbers (think about some 2-dimensional data sheets you might have encountered in excel for example) R can handle data files, and this week were going to explore them. Within R, we can specify data frames which can have, essentially, multiple columns of data, and we can link data files to data frames for processing To make things straightforward, each week well provide students with a zip file that contains the script to start from (which you can expand and annotate etc, and save on your file space). Well also provide a data file or data files for you to use in the zip file. R can then import these files into the RStudio environment. So when you upload the zip file, you can import the data AND you can open up the script 2.2 Lab exercises - descriptive information in R Studio Some years ago, a large group of participants gave an estimate of the weight of Penelope the cow. Just over 17,000 guesses. And the distribution of guesses was something like this: What we can see from this graph is that: Guesses formed a roughly normal distribution. There is a bit of a skew with a right-hand tail, but this is inevitable as a weight of less than 0 is physically impossible, but there is no limit of the semantics of a large guess. The mean guess weight (1,287 lbs) is very close to the actual (true) weight of the cow (1,355 lbs). So even though lots of people were inaccurate, a central tendency measure has a pretty good alignment with the true weight. This is known as the Wisdom of Crowds phenomenon, first identified by Galton in 1907 (though he suggested using the median weight) Lets look at (a sample of) the PSYC121 student data collected on guessing the weight of Penelope, and ask whether it resembles the properties of this large dataset. 2.2.1 Loading the data Using the instructions and advice given on Moodle, get the week2.zip file and bring the data and R script into R Studio. The week 2 zip file is here 2.2.2 Using the R script Step 1. Download the week_2.zip file (If you are using a mac, there is a video guide on Moodle to explain how to download the zip file as is) Step 2. Open the appropriate folder on the RStudio server Step 3. Upload the zip file Lets start working with our data, by opening up (clicking on) the script Week_2.R file. The first command is to load a library of functions: library(tidyverse) To run this, simply click anywhere on line 1 of the R script to put the cursor there, and press ctrl+enter (cmd+enter on a mac) or click the button called run. You will see a number of messages appear in the console. Dont worry about these, or worry too much about what exactly this command is doing. Essentially this is giving us some useful tools for our analysis. We will introduce the features of the tidyverse gradually during this course. (side note: If you were using a local version of R studio on your computer, it might not have the tidyverse library already installed. You would need to install the package first) The data are on the RStudio server if you have followed all the lab sheet to this point. Note that when you imported the data into the R environment, a command line was generated at the console cows &lt;- read_csv(&quot;~/penelope22.csv&quot;) What this command accomplished was to read the spreadsheet called penelope22 into an object in R called cows. You could use any object label, but its important to then keep that name consistent in what you do next. The command was also generated View(cows) which presents the data in a window of RStudio. Note that NA means not available or missing data. Does this file structure make some sense to you? 2.2.3 Finding the mean and median estimates Use the data to answer the following questions What is the mean weight estimates? What is the standard deviation of the estimates? What is the median weight of the estimates? Which of these central tendency measures is the more accurate measure of the true cow weight? (make a judgement) What is the mean weight estimate (and standard deviation) for female respondents and non-female (male / non-binary /prefer not to say) respondents? You may be thinking, how do I possibly do any of this?! Well this week most of the commands you need are contained in the R script you have downloaded. Also, remember from last week, we explored the R command: mean(week_1_lecture_dataa) That gave us the mean of the small dataset week_1_lecture_data. This time, we want to explore the penelope dataset. But also, the lecture_data was just a single list of numbers. The penelope22 object is more like a datasheet. So we need to tell R Studio which column we are interested in. RStudio uses the format data$column. So run the followinbg line in the script mean(cows$estimate) sd(cows$estimate) So from this, can you work out what you would do to get the median value (remember from last week how we got the median value?)? Part fo the command is given to you, can you change the text so that it works? 2.2.4 Calculations from a range of columns We have seen that: mean(cows$estimate) will provide a mean of the column estimate. In the third column, named female_estimate, we have the estimates of just the female respondents. In the fourth column, named other_estimate, we have the estimates of the other respondents (males and non-binary and prefer not to say). So can you now figure out how you might get information about the estimate from the female data (only) or the non-female data? Try it, based on what you have just done. Does it work? You will find that the result of the this command produces an NA result. This means that the answer is Not Available, or in other words, is a missing value. This is because some of the values in this column are NA, and the mean of a column with NAs will always lead to the result NA. Instead, try change the script so it looks like this: mean(cows$female_estimate, na.rm = TRUE ) Any different? The na.rm = TRUE instruction tells RStudio that missing data can be ignored in this mean calculation. (in technical language, na.rm is a parameter of the function mean that removes the NAs if set to TRUE) 2.2.5 Simple graphs RStudio can be used to create graphical data plots that can help interpret datasets The first thing we can do is create a histogram distribution of guesses from the sample student data to compare with the previous large sample study (i.e. the 17,000 guesses): hist(cows$estimate) One way to alter or adjust the histogram is to change the width of the bars, the intervals, between each plot section. Try run this line from the script hist(cows$estimate, breaks = ??) Does it work? No? What you need to do is replace the two question marks in the script (or better still, create a new instruction line in which you amend this to have a numerical value representing the number of different plot bars. Try at least 3 different values. Look at and think about how this affects the visual distribution. We can also create a box and whisker plot. Heres a general simple description of a box-and-whisker plot as a graphical representation of data: 2.2.6 Additional challenge In the zip file, we also provide data on the estimates of the percentage of immigrants in the UK. This will allow you to explore the data discussed in the analysis lecture, and create visualisations of the data and its spread. Can you apply the analysis of the penelope data to the immigration data?

You also found the weight estimates for the female and non-female guesses, right? However, in order to find the estimates separately for gender identity, we needed to have a column for each gender category. Whilst that worked, it could get cumbersome over time always to work with data created like that. There is a better way 3.2.1 Task 1 - More with the penelope22 data Step 1. This week, we again want to explore commands from the tidyverse library (toolkit) which can help us do more powerful things more elegantly. So lets get R to work with the tidyverse library library(tidyverse) Step 2. Explore help() commands. R can give you more information about how it works. Step 3. Creating a project and a folder, and setting the working directory Step 4. Bring the week3.zip file into R Studio server. Like last week, upload the zip file, and launch the R script.You can get the file here Step 5. Read or load the penelope data into R. Have a look at it using the View() command in the script This time, lets ask for the estimate data arranged by identity: aggregate(x = *MISSING*2$estimate, by = list(*MISSING*$identity), FUN = mean) First, lets try this (you will need to use your object name in place of MISSING). What do you get? Does this match what we did last week when we calculated the mean for the female and for the other (i.e., non-female) group? Second, lets look at what is happening here: aggregate This is a command to call for descriptive statistics x= This defines what column we are analyzing by=list Now we tell R how to group the estimate data, and which column does that FUN=mean Specifies which descriptive function is being asked for Can you explore whether you can call on alternate measures?) 3.2.1.1 group_by() Theres another way that also allows us to group scores by a (nominal) variable. This is explored in the learnr tutorial, which should help you create the command the get weight estimates broken down by gender identity. You need to define the data frame for the estimates data, and the gender IV and the estimates DV *MISSING* %&gt;% group_by(*MISSING*) %&gt;% summarise(mean_estimate = mean(*MISSING*)) First, try this command and see what you get. If you run this command as entered, it wont work. So now use your experience at skills from the above and the learnr tutorial to work out what is required. Note %&gt;% This is called a pipe operator, basically take the output from the left and feed it into the requests on the right. Summarise Provide summary statistics information for the specified variable as specified (whether mean, median etc) 3.2.1.2 The assignment operator As well as learning about the pipe operator, we want to remind you /draw attention explicitly to another important element of the R command line syntax: the assignment operator. Uing a command such as cows &lt;- read_csv(\"penelope22.csv\") looks for the csv datafile called penelope22, and assign it to an object or variable called cows We could create any object name we wanted (within limits of names already known to RStudio). It isnt just for reading in data files, we can perform a whole range of functions and assign them to an object. 3.2.1.3 Task 2 - Salary data Using aggregate and summarise may not seem like much progress, because they are just replicating what we had already done with mean() is week 2. However (a) this emphasizes that there are often several ways to get at the same thing in R (b) now we know about grouping, about working with 2-dimensional data, we can start to do more efficient and informative things. Now, lets turn to the guesses made about median salary in the UK. We can get the data from the file wages in the week_3.zip file (you will need to adapt the code in the script for the penelope data so that it will load in the wages data) Lets take a peek at the dataset with glimpse(wages) Glimpse pretty much does what you might think from the meaning of the word  it just gives us a data sample (handy because this is a much bigger dataset) and shows that we have 3 columns; uk_region (where someone lives, note other probably equals Northern Ireland, Europe, China, etc), family_position (age relationship with siblings), and salary (estimate). By the way, the govt statistics say the actual median income in 2019 was approx. £30,350 see this link Writing into your script, use the working aggregate commands from task 1 with the penelope weight data to find out the salary guesses as a function of where someone lives? That is, can you adapt that code for this problem? First, make sure you read in the data file into an R object. Can you use the aggregate command to find out salary guess as a function of family relationships? (if you are the youngest child maybe you have older siblings earning money that changes your evaluation?) Can you get a breakdown of guess as a function of BOTH UK region AND family relationship together? Can you use the group by() command to display salary guesses as a function of where someone lives? Check this this gives you the same answer 3.2.2 Task 3 - Phone Use data Datset 3: Use the dataset of phone screen time usage to further explore and consolidate the group_by() command (ie well drop the aggregate command for this task to focus on group_by(). Adapt script lines from the above two tasks to read in and calculate screen time usage as a function of the type of phone. Use RStudio to figure out the overall mean salary estimate and the standard deviation. Calculate by hand what salary estimate would have a z score of z=-1.5? 3.2.3 Task 4 - Final challenge: visualisation Can you find a way to visualise the screentime usage data that you have been working with above? The script provides two ways to consider doing this - boxplots (which we have looked at in script commands already) and ggplot, which we have spent less time with but is an extremely powerful engine for creating plots. Weve provided the start of the code in each case, leaving you to work out the specifics. Remember to annotate your creations! 3.2.4 Now youre finished  Remember to complete your notes in the script, save the script file, and end the server session.

Launch the week_4 R script as before. {If youve done Step 1 &amp;2 already as a pre-lab preparation, super, pat yourself on the back, skip these steps an move on)} Step 3. Once again, were gong to be using commands from the tidyverse library (the pipe operator is one example) so we need to ensure that its active. Run the command library(tidyverse) Step 4. Read in the datafiles that will be on the server. Theres already a script line for this, you just need to change the file name (see the comments for advice on this) Step 5. Weve provided a suggestion of how you can complete the visualisation challenge task from week 3. Step 6. Customize you graph work. Weve provided some suggestions about adding titles and labels for your graph. Edit and play with the script lines to make them useful to you and to understand how they work. Try change the text, the colours, and so on of the graphs. Add comments for yourself about what the different commands do. The idea is to learn by trying different things out (changing values, taking out elements of the command, putting other is) and record for yourself. If you are struggling or not sue, try look at help files. 4.4 Section 2: z-scores Hint / Reminder: Sketch a normal (z score) distribution and mark the mean/mode, and mark off the relevant parts of the question so you know what you are trying to achieve and how to interpret any calculations you make. Hint/ Reminder 2. For questions 6 &amp; 7, remember that from the week 4 lecture material, typically in psychology we use the 5% level as a cutoff to decide, in broadly described terms, whether something is extreme or unlikely vs. at least somewhat plausible or likely. 4.4.1 z-scores 1 z-score distributions Q1. What is the relationship between the sign of a z-score and its position in a distribution? Q2. If a distribution has a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 10, what is the raw score equivalent to a z-score of 1.96? Q3. If a distribution has a mean of 157 and a standard deviation of 19, what is the raw score equivalent to a z-score of 1? 4.4.2 z-scores 2 Using z-score tables Q4. What proportion of scores lie between the mean and a z-score of 0.5? Q5. What is the combined proportion of scores lying between z=-1.2 and z=.85? 4.4.3 z-scores 3 Applying z-scores to inferential problems Q6. A Neuropsychologist has presented a test of face recognition to 200 neurotypical participants and finds that the scores are normally distributed with a mean of 85 and the standard deviation of 12. Two brain-damaged patients are also given the test. The one with right hemisphere brain damage scored 58 and the one with left hemisphere damage scored 67. What is the z score of the right hemisphere patient when compared to the neurotypical group? What proportion of neurotypical participants score lower that this patient?
