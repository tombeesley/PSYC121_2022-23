At the moment the content represents the lab materials for the PSYC121 and PSYC122 modules in first year. They feature tuition of programming with R, with material designed to be accessible for students without any programming background. 1.1 Analysis labs and pre-lab work Where the 121 Analysis lab includes a pre-lab section  such as this one!  please ensure you have (a) watched the relevant pre-recorded lecture material (b) read through this section before your assigned lab class session and (c) completed any specified exercises. The lecture is designed to deliver important ideas and procedures for learning about analysis. Pre-lab material is then designed to help consolidate this learning, or enhance, expand and apply it in ways that set the scene for the lab session activity. We want to prepare you to be ready to go in the session itself and make the most of your time there. Top tip for part 1: Going into sessions prepared will help you get more out of the teaching.` Getting an overview or briefing on what you will be doing by reading relevant material etc, means you know what to expect, and where to focus your energy. Dont be shy about coming with questions! 1.2 Computing systems For all University systems you will need to be a registered user and have received a `username` and details about how to generate your `password`. If you are struggling to set this up, then contact ISS ASAP. All staff and students have e-mail accounts on the University system. Normally an e-mail address takes the form: first initial.surname@lancaster.ac.uk For example, to contact the Content Director of PSYC121, Tom Beesley, you use t.beesley@lancaster.ac.uk (usually you can also use the shortened version, t.beesley@lancs.ac.uk) When the department needs to contact you individually we send a message to your university e-mail account. In addition, the University e-mail security system, specifically the SPAM prevention procedures, will frequently junk e-mail from external accounts from free systems (e.g., hotmail, google, etc.). Its always preferable to use your University email account so staff know it is a genuine student request. Consequently we stress that you: DO NOT use external accounts when contacting the Department or Staff as messages from these are not guaranteed to be delivered (and are routinely not replied to by Staff) Check your university account daily, as important University and Departmental messages may be in this mailbox Moodle Moodle plays a key role in your time at Lancaster. Moodle is the University VLE (Virtual Learning Environment). Moodle is used to: Communicate course information and urgent messages to all students on a course. As a result it is essential for all students to log in at least once a day Make course materials, such as lectures, lecture slides/notes, and lab handouts, accessible to students prior to these sessions Provide the web links for each Web-Based Assessment (WBA) Provide forums for online discussions regarding course material (students are encouraged to use these forums to raise questions about course material that they seek clarity on) 1.3 Other Department research systems The Department SONA system In your full online Part I handbook you can read about the Research Participation Scheme (run through the SONA system). This scheme offers students the opportunity to take part in research studies. The studies cover a range of research topics and are interesting to take part in. They provide an invaluable learning opportunity for students in terms of how to design experiments, how to treat participants in an ethical manner and how to run an experiment. Many research studies in the first term will be carried out by final-year undergraduates collecting data for their research projects. This may well be you in a couple of years time!  Psychology students registered on PSYC121 are strongly encouraged to take part in these studies and collect a minimum of 20 credits* [* this is an estimate at the time of writing - the target will be communicated when confirmed within the department]. There are multiple incentives. First, completion of these credits is an essential pre-requisite to use the SONA system to recruit participants to your own study when you enter your third year. (nb you are required to carry out your own research project as part of your Psychology degree). This benefit of this access should NOT be underestimated. Second, once you have collected 20 credits, you will be able to collect additional credits, and earn further project credits for yourself in the third year. But also, taking part in studies, run by other undergraduates, or postgraduates or Research Assistants or staff, is a fantastic way to learn about research methods and experimental designs and psychology in general. Time and again, many students tell us that they got great ideas for projects and for good experiments from their experiences as participants. Being a research participant provides unique insights into what goes on in experiments and what we can learn from them. You will receive more information about SONA  such as how to register to gain access to studies  in the next couple of weeks. "],["week-1-introduction-to-statistics-with-r-studio.html", "2 Week 1: Introduction to Statistics with R Studio 2.1 Lab Work", " 2 Week 1: Introduction to Statistics with R Studio Written by John Towse &amp; Tom Beesley The exercises in this section are designed to familiarise you with working in R Studio. 2.1 Lab Work 2.1.1 Introducing R Studio R and R Studio is the software that we will be using to explore and learn about analysis in your Psychology degree. Its a computational engine: a very snazzy calculator that you should see as your friend and ally in the journey to understand and appreciate psychology. It sits alongside what we teach about the concepts and interpretation of statistical analysis. R is the core software, R Studio is the interface for interacting with it. Put another way, R is the engine, R Studio is the cockpit. Like even a simplest calculator, it just does what you ask (at least when you ask nicely!) but it requires the user to know what they want from it and to understand what it is telling you. A calculator cant help a kid get the right answer to a multiplication problem if they dont know the difference between multiplication and division and addition etc. And whilst a calculator is brilliant at doing the number crunching (and as a bonus, R Studio can help with turning the numbers into beautiful graphs and images too), even a calculator requires a thoughtful person to take the answers and make sensible interpretations from them. Therefore, we need to learn both about the concepts of statistical analysis on the one hand, and the processing of statistical information -through R- on the other. The lectures will provide the starting point and the direction for statistical concepts, whilst these analysis labs provide the more practical experiences in how to use R, and how to R your ally. Over the next year, in these labs we will increasingly be using R Studio to focus on the latter, processing side, which will allow you to focus your energies on the conceptual side and its relevance for appreciating psychology. 2.1.2 Getting started with R Studio For Lancaster University Psychology Students in 2021, we will be learning about R Studio through a simple but powerful web server architecture. That is, through the power of the internet, you can access and use R Studio by logging into a free account that we have provided and we will maintain for your use. Heres a little secret: There are several different ways to access R Studio. For example, you can download a copy of the software onto your computer, or use a Virtual Machine set up to run a copy. Theres nothing to stop you having your local copy, but please note - we cant support your own version through lab classes So why are we using an R Studio web server? Uniformity of experience. It doesnt matter whether you have a PC, a Mac, a Chromebook or whatever. The server provides a consistent, uniform experience. That also means we can spend more time helping you master the software, rather than translating between versions on different platforms Ubiquity of experience. There are lots of computers on campus. There are computer rooms, there are pods in the learning centre, there are bookable laptops in the Levy Lab, and so on. Providing a web interface from a browser, means you can practice R from all the different machines. Your not limited to a particular copy on a single machine. Consistency of performance. Since everyone logs into the same installation of R Studio, we can ensure that things work the way we expect. This allows staff to focus on teaching you the key issues, without worrying about software conflicts because different machines have different configurations, or different versions with different features etc. Well have more time to focus on the important stuff! Quality of performance. Some installations of R Studio and some commercial versions of the server are set up, well, to be the basic version rather than the premium version. To draw a papelle: do you want to have to put up with the cheap, low-bandwidth broadband package? Weve got control of the server set up, so well try and make this the most effective way to do this. Weve moved to the R Studio server approach this year. Weve tried hard to set it up to work well- Apologies in advance for any teething issues, we will try to resolve them as quickly as possible. You will have received an email with your account information to log onto the R Studio server. Please keep your account details safe. From a computer on the campus wifi, you can access R Studio at: psy-rstudio.lancaster.ac.uk (off campus, you will need to be on the VPN) At the login screen, use your university username (e.g., bloggsj) Your password for R Studio is: [password here] 2.1.2.1 What does it look like? When RStudio starts, it will look something like this: RStudio has three panels or windows: there are tabs for Console (taking up the left hand side), Environment (and History top right) , Current file (bottom right). You will also see a 4th window for a script or set of commands you develop, also (on the left hand side). 2.1.3 Lets do something! In the console window on the left hand side, theres a command prompt &gt;. This is where we ask RStudio to do our bidding! Click in the console window and we will get R to work as a calculator. Type in: 5 + 5 and press enter. You should get the answer (amazing huh? OK, maybe not that amazing). Use your imagination  ask a simple arithmetic question of your own choosing! In the first analysis lecture, we looked at measures of central tendency and how to calculate them. So lets get R to do these calculations also! First, we tell R about the data from the lecture. Copy the following line and paste it into the console, then press enter to run it: PSYC121_week_1_data &lt;- c(7,8,8,7,3,1,6,9,3,8) This creates an object called Analysis_week1_data. We can then perform calculations on this object. For example, we can find the mean by using the following command (again, copy and paste) mean(PSYC121_week_1_data) Check the answer is the same we found in the lecture (it should be 6!). Next, lets ask for the median: median(PSYC121_week_1_data) This also should be the answer from the lecture (7) R doesnt have a single corresponding command for the mode, but we can use this series of commands: getmode &lt;- function(PSYC121_week_1_dataa) { uniqv &lt;- unique(PSYC121_week_1_data) uniqv[which.max(tabulate(match(PSYC121_week_1_data, uniqv)))] } getmode(PSYC121_week_1_data) This is just a bit of clever jiggery-pokery that gets the mode. 2.1.4 Extra content The commands above are designed to show you that with RStudio active, you can get quick and accurate answers to material covered in PSYC121 lectures. All we have asked is that you write (or copy in) text to get the information. However, after the lab, you could play around with RStudio in your own time and think about the following: In R, &lt;- is the assignment operator as in the command we used: PSYC121_week_1_data &lt;- c(7,8,8,7,3,1,6,9,3,8) We create the variable label on the left (Analysis_week1_data) and we give it those number on the right. The name Analysis_week1_data is largely arbitrary: try use a variable of your own naming (your own name?) instead - and then use that alternative name for the other commands. Throughout this year, well use the convention of the underscore to separate words in labels (it_makes_them_easier_to_read than ifyoudidnthaveanyspaces) What does that tell you about the text used to get the mode? Can you figure out what each line does? Also, once you have created a variable, you can check what the variable comprises by calling it at the command line. Just write its name, and R will respond with all the data points (all the X values it knows about). Take note that, as you write the variable label, R studio should offer to auto-complete the name. It only does that if it you have defined the variable, or are writing a known command.

This will allow you to try out some useful lab skills before your main lab. Please make sure youve looked at and followed through the exercises here: https://ma-rconnect.lancs.ac.uk/PSYC121_W2_labprep/ 3.1.1 File organisation We also recommend that you set up your University H drive by following the instructions here If you do this, you can organise your files in one place and access them from any university computer that you log in to, including the lab machines in the Levy Lab and the virtual machine (see above). So this effectively acts as a free, cloud-based storage solution for your work (and even personal stuff). However you choose to store your files, its essential that you are careful about file organisation. As you progress through these exercises, you will find yourself downloading many data files, and creating many R scripts. Consider each week a new set of materials that should have its own folder. Get used to organising your work and you will be well placed to revise the material at a later date. 3.1.2 R Studio tasks For a reminder of how to start R Studio, see the Week 1 content. You can access the RStudio Server at: http://psy-rstudio.lancaster.ac.uk/ (remember: off campus, you will need to be on the VPN) 3.1.3 Bringing data, scripts and files into R Studio In week 1, we had a tiny dataset that we entered into R through command line. Were going to need a way to tell R about bigger datasets though, so we need to work with datafiles, and bring them into R so that they can form data frames and other forms of data objects in R. Weve provided (on moodle) a walk-though of how to get a data file (in a zip compressed file) into the R environment. Note, once we have imported it into R, its no longer the original file started with, but within R is has become a named data frame. 3.2 Lab exercises 3.2.1 Descriptive information in R Studio Some 5 years ago, a large group of participants gave an estimate of the weight of Penelope the cow. Just over 17,000 guesses. And the distribution of guesses was something like this: What we can see from this graph is that: Guesses formed a roughly normal distribution. There is a bit of a skew with a right-hand tail, but this is inevitable as a weight of less than 0 is physically impossible, but there is no limit of the semantics of a large guess. The mean guess weight (1,287 lbs) is very close to the actual (true) weight of the cow (1,355 lbs). So even though lots of people were inaccurate, a central tendency measure has a pretty good alignment with te true weight. This is known as the Wisdom of Crowds phenomenon, first identified by Galton in 1907 (though he suggested using the median weight) Lets look at (a smaple of) the PSYC121 student data from 2021 collected on guessing the weight of Penelope, and ask whether it resembles the properties of this large dataset. 3.2.2 Loading the data To get the data into R Studio, you need to complete the following steps: Download the zip file by clicking this link Find the location of the file on your computer and check it is saved as a .zip file Return to RStudio and navigate to the folder you want to upload the data into (you could create a new folder for this week). Click Upload Check the target directory is correct Click choose file and find the file on your computer. Select the file and click Open. Click OK You should now see the files extracted in the directory. If you receive an unexpected server error please try this process in a different browser. If you still have trouble, send your username to us t.beesley@lancaster.ac.uk for support. 3.2.3 Using the R script Lets start working with our data, by opening up the Week_2_script.R file. Its part of the zip file for week 2. This is an R script that contains a series of commands. We could type each of these in the console window (like we did in Week 1), but by having them in a script like this, it saves us typing them or copying and pasting them into the console. It also means we have a record of all the commands we have run. The first command is to load a library of functions: library(tidyverse) To run this, simply click anywhere on line 1 of the R script to put the cursor there, and press ctrl+enter (cmd+enter on a mac) or click the button called run. You will see a number of messages appear in the console. Dont worry about these, or worry too much about what exactly this command is doing. Essentially this is giving us some useful tools for our analysis. We will introduce the features of the tidyverse gradually during this course. (side note: If you were using a local version of R studio on your computer, it might not have the tidyverse library already installed. You would need to install the package first) To import the data into RStudio, from the csv file, simply click the Import Dataset button in the Enviornment pane. John has a video available to follow along with, if you have trouble with this bit. The data are in R studio if you have followed all the lab sheet to this point. Note that when you imported the data into the R environment, a command line was generated at the console penelope21 &lt;- read.csv(&quot;~/penelope21.csv&quot;) What this command accomplished was to read the spreadsheet called penelope21 into an object in R called penelope21. You could use any object label, but its important to then keep that name consistent in what you do next. The command was also generated View(penelope21) which presents the data in a windo of R studio. Note that NA means not available or missing data. Does this file structure make some sense to you? 3.2.4 Finding the mean and median estimates Use the data to answer the following questions What is the mean weight estimates? What is the standard deviation of the estimates? What is the median weight of the estimates? Which of these central tendency measures is the more accurate measure of the true cow weight? (make a judgement) What is the mean weight estimate (and standard deviation) for female respondents and non-female (male / non-binary /prefer not to say) respondents? You may be thinking, how do I possibly do any of this?! Well this week most of the commands you need are contained in the R script you have downloaded. Also, remember from last week, we explored the R command: mean(lecture1_data) That gave us the mean of the small dataset lecture1_data. This time, we want to explore the penelope dataset. But also, the lecture_data was just a single list of numbers. The penelope21 object is more like a datasheet. So we need to tell R Studio which column we are interested in. RStudio uses the format data$column. Hence, we can ask mean(penelope21$estimate) (this command is in the r script so you dont need to write it out) and to get a standard deviation we can use the command: sd(penelope21$estimate) So from this, can you work out what you would do to get the median value (remember from last week how we got the median value?). Part fo the command is given to you, can you change the text so that it works? 3.2.5 Calculations from a range of columns We have seen that: mean(penelope21$estimate) will provide a mean of the column estimate. In the third column, named female_estimate, we have the estimates of just the female respondents. In the fourth column, named other_estimate, we have the estimates of the other respondents (males and non-binary and prefer not to say). So can you now figure out how you might get information about the estimate from the female data (only) or the non-female data? Try it, based on what you have just done. Does it work? You will find that the result of the this command produces an NA result. This means that the answer is Not Available, or in other words, is a missing value. This is because some of the values in this column are NA, and the mean of a column with NAs will always lead to the result NA. Instead, try this command: mean(penelope21$female_estimate, na.rm = TRUE ) Any different? The na.rm = TRUE instruction tells RStudio that missing data can be ignored in this mean calculation. (in technical language, na.rm is a parameter of the function mean that removes the NAs if set to TRUE) 3.2.6 Simple graphs RStudio can be used to create graphical data plots that can help interpret datasets The first thing we can do is create a histogram distribution of guesses from the sample student data to compare with the previous large sample study (i.e. the 17,000 guesses): hist(penelope21$estimate) We can also create a box and whisker plot. Heres a general simple description of a box-and-whisker plot as a graphical representation of data: We can create a box and whisker plot for the estimate column using the following command: boxplot(penelope21$estimate) 3.3 Extra content! Want to try explore some more outside of the analysis class before next week and improve your R skillset? Try these exercises: 3.3.1 Helping yourself! If youre not sure how a command works, or some detail of command, then R itself may be able to help you. You can ask for help for example by entering the command help(mean) Try get help on other commands we have explored this week. Does the help info converge with your growing knowledge of the commands? Does the help show you some of the additional options with the commands? Can you use the examples which may accompany the help info? You can also use help() to find out more about packages rather than just commands (see next challenge). And most help info will give some example, but you can ask for examples specifically with example() (e.g. example(mean)) 3.3.1.1 Create a box-and-whisker plot of BOTH the female and non-female data on the same figure. To do so, you can use a really flexible toolkit (in R-speak, called a package) with publisher-quality graphics capabilities called ggplot2. We turned this on with the command before library(tidyverse) Have a look at the help information about for example, geom_boxplot, and try out the script information provided for week 2. The challenge is to figure out how the script instructions produce the graph  what do the elements do (maybe fiddle around with it to find out!). Good luck!

Wed really appreciate more completions so we can work with a good sample of data this term, and as a reminder, the data are here: https://lancasteruni.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6rLPbl1YI8Y2WXj Since weve got less data than we would expect, we cant yet use the data in this terms activities. 4.2 R Studio tasks For the penelope21 data in week 2, we provided you with estimates data, and you were able to generate descriptive statistics for the estimates (if not, please go back and work through that part of the week 2 lab sheet again). You also found the weight estimates for the female and non-female guesses, right? However, in order to find the estimates separately for gender identity, we needed to have a column for each gender category. Whilst that worked, it could get cumbersome over time always to work with data created like that. There is a better way 4.2.1 Task 1 - penelope21 data Download the week3.zip file and upload it into R Studio server. If you need them, here are the key instructions from Week 2. Import the penelope21 data using the read.csv() command (if unsure, see here in Week 2), and launch the R script. This week, we want to explore commands from the tidyverse library (toolkit) which can help us do more powerful things more elegantly. So lets get R to work with the tidyverse library library(tidyverse) (Nb. This command is the accompanying R script. You can access it from there.) This time, lets ask for the estimate data arranged by identity: aggregate(x = penelope21$estimate, by = list(penelope21$identity), FUN = mean) First, lets try this! What do you get? Does this match what we did last week when we calculated the mean for the female and for the other group? Second, lets look at what is happening here: aggregate This is a command to get descriptive statistics Remember we can use help to find more about this command! x= This defines what column we are analyzing by=list Now we tell R how to group the estimate data, and which column does that FUN=mean Specifies which descriptive function is being asked for Can you explore whether you can call on alternate measures?) 4.2.2 group_by() Theres another way that also allows us to group scores by a (nominal) variable. This is explored in the learnr tutorial, which should help you create the command the get weight estimates broken down by gender identity. You need to define the data frame for the estimates data, and the gender IV and the estimates DV *MISSING* %&gt;% group_by(*MISSING*) %&gt;% summarise(mean_estimate = mean(*MISSING*)) First, try this command and see what you get. If you run this command as entered, it wont work. So now use your experience at skills from the above and the learnr tutorial to work out what is required. Note %&gt;% This is a pipe operator, basically take the output from the left and feed it into the requests on the right. Summarise Provide summary statistics information for the specified variable as specified (whether mean, median etc) 4.2.3 The assignment operator As well as learning about the pipe operator, we want to introduce another important element of the R command line syntax: the assignment operator. Probably without knowing about it, weve been using this already! When a dataset is imported into R Studio from the menu, a command is created such as penelope21 &lt;- read.csv(~/penelope21.csv) What this does is look for the csv datafile called penelope21, and assign it to an object / variable called penelope21 We could create any object name we wanted (within limits of names already known to R Studio). If we wanted to work with something called week_3_data we could use week_3_data &lt;- read.csv(~/penelope21.csv) In R Studio, we would call on week_3_data rather than penelope21 in the command lines. 4.2.4 Task 2 - Salary20 data Using aggregate and summarise may not seem like much progress, because they are just replicating what we had already done with mean() is week 2. However (a) this emphasizes that there are often several ways to get at the same thing in R (b) now we know about grouping, we can start to do more efficient and informative things. Now, lets turn to the guesses made about median salary in the UK. We can get the data (created in 2020) from the file salary20 in the week 3.zip file; Lets take a peek at the dataset with glimpse(salary20) Glimpse pretty much does what you might think from the meaning of the word  it just gives us a data sample (handy because this is a much bigger dataset) and shows that we have 3 columns; UK_region (where someone lives, note other probably equals Northern Ireland, Europe, China, etc, family_position (age relationship with siblings), and median_salary guess. By the way, the govt statistics say the actual median income in 2019 was approx. £30,350 https://www.statista.com/statistics/1002964/average-full-time-annual-earnings-in-the-uk/ Can you use the aggregate command from task 1 to find out the salary guesses as a function of where someone lives? That is, can you adapt that code for this problem? Can you use the aggregate command to find out salary guess as a function of family relationships? (if you are the youngest child maybe you have older siblings earning money that changes your evaluation?) Can you get a breakdown of guess as a function of BOTH UK region AND family relationship together? Can you adapt the summarise command to display salary guesses as a function of where someone lives? Use R Studio to figure out the overall mean salary estimate and the standard deviation. Calculate by hand what salary estimate would have a z score of z=-1.5?

In others words, describe the DV a function of an IV Those two approaches involved aggregate(x = DV, by = list(IV), FUN = mean) and data.frame %&gt;% group_by(IV) %&gt;% summarise(mean_estimate = mean(DV)) Use the week 3 learnr tutorial from last week to get more hints and practice with this, if you need to, alongside the week 4 tutorial. 5.2.1 Task 1 - Climate change data Download the week4.zip file and upload it into R Studio server. If you need them, here are the key instructions from Week 2. This week the data is called climate. Launch the week_4 R script as before. Step 2. Once again, were gong to be using commands from the tidyverse library (the pipe operator is one example) so we need to ensure that its active. Run the command: library(tidyverse) (Nb. This command is the accompanying R script. You can access it from there.) In the climate data frame, there are the following variables: human_CC - A response to the question: How much do you think human activity contributes to climate change, as a percentage of overall climate change? Please enter a value between 0 (humans do not contribute to climate change at all) and 100 (human contribute entirely to climate change). UK_region - where in the UK you used to live country_visits - the number of countries you have visited visit_category - a number between 1-3 1 means you have visited 1-4 countries 2 means you have visited 5-9 countries 3 means you have visited more than 9 countries Step 3. Maybe belief in human activity as a contributor to climate change varies across the UK? Find out which region of the UK has the highest and the lowest belief in the relative role of human activity in climate change. Change the following command based on what was learnt last week and the current data described above Data_frame_name %&gt;% group_by(IV) %&gt;% summarise(mean_estimate = mean(DV)) Step 4. Maybe views about climate change are affected by how well travelled you are? Because you see the global impacts of clmate change, or because travel (often producing carbon emissions) is a sign of not being worried. So use the climate_change_category to look at whether there are differences in rating of human contribution to climate change. 5.2.2 Extra activity. Come back to this afterwards for some extra practice if you want: Use the learnr activities to think about visualisation of the climate data. What graph(s) would be useful? How can you customise them? 5.3 Z-scores Hint / Reminder: Sketch a normal (z score) distribution and mark the mean/mode, and mark off the relevant parts of the question so you know what you are trying to achieve and how to interpret any calculations you make. Hint/ Reminder 2. For questions 6 &amp; 7, remember that from the week 4 lecture material, typically in psychology we use the 5% level as a cutoff to decide, in broadly described terms, whether something is extreme or unlikely vs. at least somewhat plausible or likely. 5.3.1 z-scores 1: distributions Q1. What is the relationship between the sign of a z-score and its position in a distribution? Q2. If a distribution has a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 10, what is the raw score equivalent to a z-score of 1.96? Q3. If a distribution has a mean of 157 and a standard deviation of 19, what is the raw score equivalent to a z-score of 1? 5.3.2 z-scores 2: Using z-score tables Q4. What proportion of scores lie between the mean and a z-score of 0.5? Q5. What is the combined proportion of scores lying between z=-1.2 and z=.85? 5.3.3 z-scores 3: Applying z-scores to inferential problems Q6. A Neuropsychologist has presented a test of face recognition to 200 neurotypical participants and finds that the scores are normally distributed with a mean of 85 and the standard deviation of 12. Two brain-damaged patients are also given the test. The one with right hemisphere brain damage scored 58 and the one with left hemisphere damage scored 67. What is the z score of the right hemisphere patient when compared to the neurotypical group? What proportion of neurotypical participants score lower that this patient? Is this patient likely to belong to the population of neurotypical participants? (justify your answer) What is the z score of the left hemisphere patient when compared to the neurotypical group? What proportion of neurotypical participants score lower than this patient? Is this patient likely to belong to the population of neurotypical participants? (justify your answer) 5.3.4 Extra activity Come back to this afterwards for some extra practice if you want: Q7. Tim Bizzley has measured the foot size of men and women and found each to be normally distributed. The men have a mean size of 55 with a standard deviation of 5 and the women a mean of 33 and a standard deviation of 5. Joanna Toes has foolishly measured two individuals but forgotten to note their gender. These have foot sizes of 37 and 47. To which gender is each more likely to belong? What evidence is there for this?

We will then conduct our first statisitical test to tell whether there is a real difference in our data. You must ensure you have watched the lecture and done the pre-lab work before coming to class. 6.1 Pre-lab work: online tutorial To access the pre-lab tutorial click here (on campus, or VPN required) 6.2 RStudio Task 1: Creating a new folder and project We are going to set up a new folder for this week and an RStudio Project. This is a good practice for organising your scripts and data. When you are logged on to the RStudio Server, navigate to your home directory by clicking on the small house icon: Click the New Folder button just above the home button. Name the folder something sensible (e.g., Week_6) and click OK. Click on this folder and then click More and Set As Working Directory. This tells RStudio that you are now working in this directory. When you read in data using read.csv it will know where to look for the file name that you provide. Lets add the files we need for this week. Download the Week_6.zip and upload it into RStudio Server. If you need them, here are the key instructions from Week 2. Now lets finish this process by making this a Project. Click on the small blue icon in the top right of RStudio, and clicking New Project: You may be asked to save the workspace or data - you should do this. Then select Existing Directory and make sure that the new directory you have created is selected as the Project Working Directory - it should be, if you set the working directory correctly above. If not, navigate to the correct directory here. And youre done! This should now appear as a project in your front page on RStudio. You can get back to that front page by clicking the red power button in the top right corner. Using projects has many benefits. It will keep all the content for the week in one place, and save the commands youve used in the console. You can also use the Project Menu to navigate quickly between different projects. 6.3 RStudio Task 2: Visualising phone use Its time to put the skills you learnt in the online tutorial into practice with a new data set. In the survey, people estimated their daily phone use, and then looked up the actual time their phones were on. This data is provided in the zip file. Open the script Week_6_script.R. This is the script file you will use for this task and the next one (3). Run the first two lines of code library(tidyverse) and data_w6 &lt;- read_csv(\"data_phone.csv\"). Note that the read_csv() function is another way to import data. A shortcut version of using the Import Dataset action. You should now have an object in environment called data_w6. You can view this (the spreadsheet view) by clicking on the object. Try running the ggplot command. You will see that this generates an error in red. Oh no!! Dont panic. Look at what its telling you is wrong. Lets look at the ggplot command and edit it to make it display something. As a reminder from the online tutorial: The main graphing command is ggplot() which tells R we want to draw some kind of plot. If you want to, you can just run data_w6 %&gt;% ggplot(), and youll see that R produces just a blank plot window. The plot is blank because we havent told it a) what type of plot we want, and b) what data to plot. Note that the next line is added to ggplot() (i.e., ggplot() + geom_point()). Plotting with ggplot() involves adding elements (geoms) together. Think of it as adding layers on top of each other: the ggplot() is your pizza base, and the geoms and other features are the toppings! Within the geom_point() command we have the very important command of aes(). This stands for aesthetics. aes() tells ggplot how the data should be represented on the features of the plot. Add y and x components inside the aes() command. These are used to map variables in your data to the features of the graph. If you are stuck on this, its time to go back and look at the Inside the aes() command, map the variable screen_time_estimate to the x axis, and the variable screen_time_actual to the y axis. In general, does it look like peoples estimates were accurate? Add a setting for colour outside of the aes(), to make all the points red. Why outside of aes()? Well remember from the online tutorial: Careful observation of the code here will show you that these new commands are written outside of the aes() command. This is really important to note. We write these outside of aes() because these features of the plot are not related to the data. We are NOT mapping any of our data to these features. Instead, we are simply specifying one particular value for each of these settings in the plot Now map the colour to the variable phone_type (within aes()). Can you see any differences between people who have different phones? Try changing your geom_point() command to geom_jitter() (keeping the mappings the same). Suddenly this reveals many more points! Why is this? Check the help to find out more about this geom: ?geom_jitter. 6.4 RStudio Task 3: Conducting a binomial test Lets now look at whether these differences we see are meaningful. Do people estimate their daily screen time to be more than it actually is? There are two blocks of code to run here. You dont have to edit these, but its important to look at what they are doing: Run the first block of code. This adds a new column to the data, est_diff, which means the estimate difference: actual screen time minus estimated screen time. You can take a look at this code by clicking on the new object in the environment, data_phone_diff. What do the positive and negative values reflect? Run the second block of code. This filters out (!= means not equal to) the zero values in the est_diff column. Why is this important for the sign test? The result of the final line of code (count()) will be output in the console. This tells us how many values were above 0 (TRUE) and how many below zero (FALSE). This is all the information we need to conduct our statistical test: How many positive values were there (above 0)?. How many observations were there in total? Add these two values to the two MISSING values in code for the binomial test Run the test and read the output - and take note of the p-value This tells us how likely such a result would be if the null hypothesis was true. Does this mean there is a significant over or underestimate in peoples estimates of phone time usage? 6.5 Extra content! Visualising data is all about communication: how can I communicate my results so that it makes the data very easy to interpret. Try these additional steps: Add a labs() layer to modify text on the graph. If youre not sure how to do this, then feel free to go back to the online tutorial, or take a look at the help wiht ?labs. Try changing the axis titles and add a title for the graph. Change the theme of the graph. Try ?theme_classic for help. Graphs can be saved by clicking Export, then Save as image. Set the dimensions to how you like it to look, give it a suitable filename, and click save.

We will first plot this data using geom_histogram() and also geom_boxplot(). When we do this, well see that there are some unusual values, and well need to do a bit of data wrangling to remove them, using the filter() command. Well then turn to the conceptual ideas of the lecture - how can we tell if the mean of our sample is unusual, or whether we would actually expect this mean value under the null hypothesis? Finally, well continue to develop our skills in data visualisation by exploring geom_density() plots. 7.1 Pre-lab work: online tutorial Online tutorial: You must make every attempt to complete this before the lab! To access the pre-lab tutorial click here (on campus, or VPN required) Getting ready for the lab class Create a folder and a Project for Week 7. Click here for the instructions from last week if you are unsure. Download the Week_7.zip and upload it into this new folder in RStudio Server. If you need them, here are the instructions from Week 2. 7.2 RStudio Task 1: Plotting and filtering Important! - You should be using the Week_7_script as you work through these tasks. Edit the script to complete the tasks. Running code from the script is easy - place your cursor on the line or block of code you want to run and press run (of ctrl/cmd+enter). See the video on Moodle if youre unsure. Save your script as you go to keep a record of your work. Open the Week_7_script and run the library, options and read_csv commands. The options command is new. It is very cryptic and you dont need to worry too much about this - it is making sure that the values in the graphs are displayed as regular numbers and not as scientific notation. Complete the geom_histogram() code to plot the distribution of salary data OK - weve got some pretty funky values here! Some people think the average salary is over £300,000!!! Well, maybe they just added too many zeros (lets give them the benefit of the doubt). Quite often when we get our raw data, it contains weird values like this that we need to consider removing. Lets run the arrange() code now to see what exactly those high values are. Well need to remove these high values to get a better sense of the distribution. Lets use a filter() command to do this. We need to make a decision about what values to exclude. In later labs well look at a more systematic process of removing outliers, but for now, lets just remove any that are over £200,000. Edit the filter() command to keep only those estimates that are below £200,000 (&lt;). Remeber that the filter command keeps the data that is TRUE according to the expression. Also note that you are making a new object at this step: data_w7_f . Now your filter has done its job (check the Environment to make sure data_w7_f has fewer rows than data_w7), lets plot the data again. Edit the aes() command of this next code chunk to draw a new histogram. And as you know, we can also look at the distribution as a boxplot. Edit the geom_boxplot() code to do this. 7.3 RStudio Task 2: One-sample t-test We now want to know if the salary estimates are different to the actual average salary in the UK (which is approx. £30,000). Our hypothesis might be that people are inaccurate - they overestimate or underestimate the average UK salary. Lets test that. The first step towards this is to calculate a mean of the column of salary estimates. Edit the line of code with mean() to tell R to compute this value. Remember to use the new data object you created after you removed the outliers. If youre struggling to remember how to compute a mean(), jump back to the Week 2 content Now we can compute a t-statistic and check its significance with t.test(). Edit the code on this line to conduct a one-sample t-test. You need to tell it the mean value of your sample (step 7), and the expected mean under the null hypothesis. Remember our hypothesis is that people are not accurate. Your calculation of the mean should tell you whether they numerically overestimated or underestimated. But would we expect such a result under the null hypothesis? Run the t-test and note the p value. How likely is it that we would see this sample of data (this mean value and the distribution of data - the SD) under null hypothesis? The p value ranges from 0 to 1. If it is very low - typically we say p &lt; .05 - then we conclude our result is unlikely under the null hypothesis and it is therefore a significant result. What is the critical value of t in the t-distribution table, for this sample size? Degrees of freedom is N - 1. 7.4 RStudio Task 3: Density plots: salary estimates by home location Draw a geom_density() (density plot) by adding an x mapping for the uk_salary column inside aes(). This plot can be thought of as a smoothed version of the histogram. Now map the fill feature to the variable home_location. This should create 3 density plots, one for each home location. You might find that its a bit difficult to see the shape of all three distributions. To make things clearer, add alpha = .5 outside of the aes() command in geom_denisty(). This should make the plots a bit more transparent. Try playing around with different values of alpha between 0 and 1. Manually change the colours of the columns by adding (+) this code as a layer to your ggplot code: scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"darkgreen\", \"darkblue\", \"darkred\")).
